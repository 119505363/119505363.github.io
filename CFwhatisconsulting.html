	<p style = "color: #fabd16"> Consulting is a fairly broad term that can have a variety of meanings depending on 
		the industry it refers to. For example, you can work as a marketing consultant helping 
		companies create and optimize their marketing campaigns or as a software consultant, 
		designing software systems for an organization. However, although the term has many 
		applications, it’s generally used to refer to management or strategy consulting, 
		the practice of helping companies increase their efficiency and profits by addressing 
		the major operational or strategic challenges they’re facing.

	<h1 style = "color: #fabd16"style="font-size:200%" > Hyperautomation</h1>
	
	<p style = "color: #fabd16">As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies,
	including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. 
	Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation 
	(i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)”

		<h1 style = "color: #fabd16"style="font-size:200%" > MultiExperience </h1>
	
	<p style = "color: #fabd16">Multi-experience development platforms (MXDPs) help enterprises to rapidly scale their applications 
	across a range of devices and platforms. MXDPs can help you develop a single application that can be deployed on a variety of devices. 
	This greatly shortens down your efforts and gives brands more control over their digital experiences.

		<h1 style = "color: #fabd16"style="font-size:200%" > Distributed Cloud</h1>
	
	<p style = "color: #fabd16">Distributed, in an information technology (IT) context, means that something is shared among multiple systems 
	which may also be in different locations. Distributed cloud speeds communications for global services and enables more responsive communications 
	for specific regions.
