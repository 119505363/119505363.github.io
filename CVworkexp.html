      <h1>Work Experience</h1>
      <p>The final part of my CV consists of my previous Work Experiences.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3> *************</h3>
		<p>(13th -17th of March 2017</p>
		<p>
			During This work experience I worked as a clerical assistant.
			I worked alongside a secretary for the week. I did various jobs like filing client information,
			filling out client information forms and other various office work. I also acoompanied a solicitor
			to court and learned about how a court works.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>	********* Credit Union</p>
		<p>(4th-15th of February 2019)</p>
		<p> I worked as an administrator during this certain work experience.
			I gained a great deal of experience in using a programme called Scion.
			Scion was a programme which the credit union used to keep its database in order.
			For the two weeks that I was working here I updated client files in the database.
			I would check the clients information and store various important information into 
			a Microsoft Excel file. I also was given the task to market an exclusive loan offer
			by setting up and customizing an email which was then sent to all current and potential 
			clients that the Credit Union had.
